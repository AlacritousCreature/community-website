# What is the community workflow?

The community follows two distinct kinds of workflow which makes us different from other open-source communities.

* **Release Workflow**  
Members participating in this workflow are completely dedicated onto building a single project at any point of time. They are in complete control of the direction of the project but cannot decide how successful it can be down the line. This requires a minimum of five effective contributions per week. This workflow is the most focused and hugely challenging.

!!! question "Why should I join the release workflow?"
    A release workflow project has a larger scope and a definite deadline. These can add significant qualitative value to your experience but also requires greater contribution from your end. If you are looking for a challenge and can dedicate time towards building a really awesome project, you might want to join this workflow.

* **Rolling Workflow**  
Members participating in this workflow are completely dedicated onto maintaining multiple projects at any point of time. They do not have a say in the direction of the project but can pretty much decide how successful it can be down the line. This requires a minimum of three effective contributions per week. The workflow is moderately focused and greatly challenging.

!!! question "Why should I join the rolling workflow?"
    A rolling workflow project has a smaller scope and an indefinite deadline. These can add okayish qualitative value to your experience in exchange of much lesser contribution from your end. If you want to take it nice and slow as you are unable/unwilling to dedicate time to build a project, you might want to join this workflow.
